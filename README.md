# Gifio

Android gif sharing app built with the Giphy API on Flutter.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. For building you'll need to setup some dependencies like Android SDK, Dart SDK and Flutter SDK. In the future i will make a setup guide for Flutter projects, until then search the web hehe.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
